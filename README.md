# Lithium Isotope Composition of Seawater: Permian-Triassic Boundary

## Introduction
This repository houses the computational models for understanding the lithium isotope composition of seawater during the critical Permian-Triassic boundary period. Using data-driven analysis and advanced modeling techniques written in R, we aim to shed light on the dynamic processes that might have influenced the lithium isotope ratios during this pivotal moment in Earth's history.

## Features
1. **Modeling Parameters**: Functions to model different environmental, geological, and oceanographic parameters that can influence lithium isotope composition.
2. **Visualization**: Generate plots and graphs to visualize the changes and trends in lithium isotope composition across the Permian-Triassic boundary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R (version >= 4.0.0)
- Required R packages: (you can install them using `install.packages("package_name")`)
  - `tidyverse`
  - `lubridate`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `reshape2`
  - ... (and others as specified in the scripts)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/LithiumIsotope_PTboundary.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash
cd LithiumIsotope_PTboundary
```
3. Open the R scripts and ensure you've installed all the necessary packages.

## Usage
1. Each R script produces a model as described in the paper.
